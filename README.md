Hi this iss Black jack casino game.
 
 ðŸŽ® Features
- Random card generation
- Hit or stay option for the player
- Dealer plays automatically
- Bust and win/lose conditions
How it WORKS:

- Cards are randomly drawn from 1 to 13 (like Ace to King).

Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) count as 10.

Player can choose to "hit" (draw a card) or "stay".

If your hand goes over 21, you bust.

The dealer draws until reaching a total of at least 10.

Closest to 21 without busting wins!
